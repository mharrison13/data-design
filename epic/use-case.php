	<h1>Use Case</h1>
	<h2>A Very Bad Etsy Site</h2>
	<main>
		<p>Emanuel is a <em>Very Bad Etsy</em> user. Retired with lots of time on his hands he has taken to making viral YouTube videos where can reviews products he purchases online as a way to generate ad revenue.</p>
		<p>Three days ago, Emanuel spent 4 hours searching for products for upcoming video reviews. This morning, he revisited his <em>Very Bad Etsy</em> account and realised he has no way to go back to the products he wants to purchase. Emanuel has a poor memory and can never seem to find the pages he previously came across to purchase.</p>
		<p>With a very large following, Emanuel also wants his followers to have access to the products he has favorited on <em>Very Bad Etsy</em>.</p>
