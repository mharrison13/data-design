	<p><strong>Name:</strong> Emanuel R. Lombard</p>
	<p><strong>Age:</strong> 70</p>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Profession: </strong>Avid <em>Very Bad Etsy</em> user, and retired electronic reporter spends all of his time purchasing items online and sharing them on the social media site YouTube.</p>
	<p><Strong>Technology: </Strong>Mac user. Uses a Mac Desktop computer with a 25" samsung monitor at home, a 15 inch Mac Book Pro while out and about and an iPhone 7 with 4G connectivity.</p>
	<p><strong>Attitudes and Behavior: </strong>Retired with plenty of time on his hands, Emanuel is very technically savy for a 70 year old. His videos often go viral with his in-depth reviews of online purchases. He spends much of his time looking for new places to purchase his next video review. Emanuel is not very organized and often has a hard time remembering many of the items he comes across and relies heavily on the ability to save, bookmark and favorite the items he comes across.</p>
	<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong> Emanuel needs a way to favorite items of interest on <em>Very Bad Etsy</em> as he has no way of keeping track potential products for his video reviews. He also wants to build his <em>Very Bad Etsy</em> profile so that others can see the products that he has selected as favorites. </p>
