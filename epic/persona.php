		<strong>Age:</strong> 70</p>
	<p><strong>Profession: </strong>Avid <em>Very Bad Etsy</em> user, and retired electronic reporter spends all of his time purchasing items online and sharing them on the social media site YouTube.</p>

	<p><strong>Attitudes and Behavior: </strong>Retired with plenty of time on his hands, Emanuel is very technically savvy for a 70 year old. His videos often go viral with his in-depth reviews of online purchases. He spends much of his time looking for new places to purchase his next video review. Emanuel is not very organized and often has a hard time remembering many of the items he comes across and relies heavily on the ability to save, bookmark and favorite the items he comes across.</p>
	<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong> Emanuel needs a way to favorite items of interest on <em>Very Bad Etsy</em> as he has no way of keeping track potential products for his video reviews. He also wants to build his <em>Very Bad Etsy</em> profile so that others can see the products that he has selected as favorites. Emanuel has run out of products to showcase on his YouTube channel and is in desperate need of bringing in new products as his YouTube followers are eager to see more of his videos.</p>
	<p><strong>Goals: </strong>Emanuel wants one thing and one thing only: favorite his favorite items on <em>Very Bad Etsy.</em> Emanuel doesn't have much time to be searching for products he came across and cannot relocate. He needs to immediately favorite the item to return to at a later time.</p>
